# SVD Item Similarity Engine Template

Template to calculate similarity between items based on their attributes. 
Attributes can be either numeric or categorical in the last case it will be 
encoded using one-hot encoder. Algorithm uses SVD in order to reduce data 
dimensionality. Cosine similarity is now implemented but can be easily 
extended to other similarity measures.

## Overview

This template is a simple example of unsupervised learning algorithm 
implementation. Given items with their attributes of numeric and string types
(like movie release year, duration, director, actors, etc.) we can measure 
similarity between items based on some metric (cosine similarity in this 
example). 

Every item is represented as a set of attributes. Attributes can be of type 
String, Array of Strings and Int. Items are transformed into vectors with 
categorical variables encoded using one-hot encoder 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) i.e. every String and Array of Strings
attribute is transformed to number of binary attributes (facts about item) 
like "Is John Carpenter the director of the movie?".
So item vector length is equal to number of possible values of all categorical 
variables plus the number of numeric variables. 
 
Given such encoding of data numeric and categorical variables are not 
equivalently contribute into resulting vector (the problem is that there is 
no unified method to merge categorical and numeric attributes.). To fix this 
issue in some extent weights of numeric variables are used in this example. 

Then vectors are normalized. So that their dot product produces cosine of the
angle between vectors or in other words item-attribute matrix multiplied to 
itself transposed produces cosine similarity matrix (item to item). If we 
take into consideration that the number of attributes and items can be very 
big, then such matrix can be very big as well and it can be computationally 
difficult to calculate it, so dimensionality reduction should be used. In 
this example Singular value decomposition 
(https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-dimensionality-reduction.html#singular-value-decomposition-svd) is used. So we need to save one 
matrix of size M x K, M is the number of items and K is the number of 
dimensions we're going to use.

Data is generated from Movielens database. Genre and year is real, actor 
list, director, producer and film duration in minutes are randomly generated 
for demo purposes.  

## Engine parameters

This example has four parameters to tune. The main is __dimensions__, this 
parameter should be less or equal to min(number of items, item vector 
dimension) and represents dimensionality of the space we are projecting our 
vectorized items. This parameter should be chosen so that our model could 
grasp the data (similarity between items) from one side and were not very 
excessive from the other side. After training algorithm outputs top singular 
values and the worst case estimation of captured variability of data. Worst 
case estimation is obtained with supposition that all the left singular 
values (which are not calculated) are equal to the smallest one, the closer 
to 100% this value is the better. 

The two other parameters are __yearWeight__ and __durationWeight__. They 
represent weight of numeric attributes year and duration respectively. These 
parameters should be selected experimentally so that model would represent 
better similarity between items. No unified recipe can be offered for 
selecting them, but some intuition can be used. As both year and duration are 
scaled to zero mean and unit standard deviation their weights represent their
relative importance to any other attribute.

The last parameter is __normalizeProjection__ (true / false). SVD with 
__dimensions__ < rank of item-attribute matrix is the approximation of 
the original matrix, so all vectors will be projections of original vectors 
into space with reduced dimensionality (__dimensions__). 
In this case dot product of vectors will be less then the cosine of the angle 
between them. To fix this it is good to normalize vectors after projection is
done. It is not very necessary if singular values decay rate is high, in such
case not much of information is lost due to projection. 

## Output during train
SVD is a technique to reduce data dimensionality, the idea is to describe in the
first place the most considerable peculiarities and then gradually less and 
less considerable. The importance of every dimension (__dimensions__ 
parameter) is given by correspondent singular value, SVD algorithm works so 
that highest value is found first, then next highest and so on. The sum of 
squares of all singular values is equal to data variance, so the more 
__dimensions__ you use and the higher their correspondent singular values the
 more info about data the model preserves. 

After training is done algorithm outputs singular values and worst case 
estimation of grasped variability, the higher last tally is the better. It's 
calculated in very simple manner -- in worst case all singular values left 
are considered equal to smallest of calculated by algorithm (actually they 
should be a little bit smaller even for completely random data, but this is 
the best estimation we can have without additional assumptions), having this 
we can calculate how much of variability in such worst case has our model 
"described".

If worst case estimation of grasped variability is low, then it's wise to 
increase the number of __dimensions__. But from the other side the more 
__dimensions__ you use the longer train and prediction will work. 

It's good to consider last singular values in output too. If their decay rate
is slow i.e. every next value is very close to previous meanwhile worst case 
estimation of grasped variability is low, then the algorithm 
can not find system in data and it can mean that attributes do not describe 
similarity of items (you'll give such situation with random data, so this 
hallmark is a sign of that algorithm can not distinguish your data from random).


## Versions

### v0.0.5

## Usage

### Event Data Requirements

By default, the template requires the following events to be collected:

- item $set event, which sets the attributes of the item

### Input Query

- array of items
- number of results

### Output PredictedResult

- List of items with similarity score


## Import sample data

```
$ cd data
$ python import_eventserver.py --access_key <your_access_key>
```

The sample data for training is generated from four files:

- sample_actors.txt
- sample_directors.txt
- sample_producers.txt
- sample_movies.txt

## Build, train, deploy

As for most prediction.io templates the workflow is standard:

```
$ pio build && pio train && pio deploy
```

## Query

```
$ cd data
$ python send_query.py
```
